# SMART_SHEET_-IRYM-1-
smart sheet is a web-based platform that allows users to upload datasets (CSV, Exce, l) and describe in prompt the analysis they want.   The system uses an LLM (QWEN, Phi, ...) to interpret the prompt, generate appropriate Python code, execute it in a secure environment, and return the result as text or a basic visualization.
